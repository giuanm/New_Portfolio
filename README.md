With this portfolio I demonstrate some skills with React such as consuming APIs, using and creating hooks, routes, context, components, styled components, communication with the backend and many other features. My idea was to show my developer profile with a personal page, in which I show my professional and personal profile with the possibility of being chosen in two languages (English and Portuguese) and how I apply my skills.
